# Metricly CLI
Small script for parsing and validating packages.

## Use
**Package Validator** requires all the Netuitive packages to be cloned in the same directory so **Package Validator** can crawl that directory. **Package Validator** filters for folders which start with **netuitive-packages-** so it's fine with clone this project in the same folder as all the packages.

To run the report run `node index.js <package-directory>`.

## Single Use
**Package Validator** can be installed globally with `npm install -g git+https://git@github.com/Netuitive/netuitive-package-validator.git`. Validate a package in the current directory with `validate-package` or run `validate-package --help` for additional options.
